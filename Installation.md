# Prequisites #

Apparat requires that you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 installed on your system. You can get it from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

To make sure Java is installed open a command prompt and type `java -version`.

```
joa@macaron:~$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_22"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.1-b03, mixed mode)
```

Your output should look similar to mine and tell you that you have at least Java 1.6 installed.
