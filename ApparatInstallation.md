# Apparat Installation #

Once you have installed Scala you are good to go. Simply download either the `*`.zip archive on Windows platform or the `*`.tar.gz on `*`nix systems.

Extract the contents of that archive somewhere and you are ready to go.

A smart idea is to create the `APPARAT_HOME` environment variable and add `$APPARAT_HOME/bin` to your [PATH variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).
